# Vehicle-Identification-Number-VIN-Generation-Tool-PPC-Python-Project

**Description** This project develops a Python-based VIN generation tool for automobile industry. A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a globally recognized code that uniquely identifies each vehicle. For automobile industry, VINs are critical for manufacturing records, regulatory compliance, warranty tracking, and fleet management.
The tool ensures VINs are generated according to the given model and Variant wise structure.

**Terminology used in Project:-**
1) MODEL_NAME --> It Represents the Model Name that is Used for Product Selling in Market.
2) MODEL_CODE --> It Represents the system code of that particular model that is used for Company internal Purposes and system transactions.(Production planning/ tracking & Inventory Controlling).
3) CHECK DIGIT --> The check digit in a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is the character, used as a mathematical safeguard to verify that the VIN is valid and not mistyped or altered. It helps detect errors in transcription and ensures the authenticity of the VIN.
4)  START_SERIAL_NO --> It represents the starting serial number structure of that particular model or variant.
5)  JOB_CODE --> When manufacturers generate VINs, they often include internal codes that represent specific details about the vehicle. One of these is referred to as a Job Code.
   - A Job Code is an internal production or assembly code used by manufacturers to identify a particular build, order, or 
    job during the manufacturing process.

    Pupose:-
    - Links the VIN to a specific production job/order in the factory.
    - Helps track manufacturing batches and assembly line details.
    - Ensures traceability for quality control, warranty claims, and recalls
6) PREFIX --> In the context of a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the term “prefix” usually refers to the starting characters of the VIN, that will same for EVery VIN of that particular Model.
